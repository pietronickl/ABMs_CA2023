Copying skills, tools or knowledge from experienced individuals the prerequisite for
culture. Humans would have gotten nowhere if you couldn’t learn from parents,
teachers and peers how to make a handaxe, prepare food without poisoning yourself
or tell a good bedtime story. Therefore the transmission of knowledge is important.

But what happens if transmission isn’t perfect? What are the chances of somebody
copying a skill/tool/information with 100% fidelity? Under which circumstances does
the cultural skill set of a community expand? And when does culture break down?
