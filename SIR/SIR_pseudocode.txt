########## DEFINE AGENTS AND BEHAVIOUR #############################

# agents live on a grid of a certain size
# and can take one of three states:
# Susceptible, Infected or Recovered
# maybe we just call them states 0, 1, 2

# everbody starts with state 0
# but one randomly picked agent gets infected 

# when an agent is infectious, their neighbors will also be infected 
# with a certain probability, and the originally infected recovers
        

########## FOR LOOP, SAVING KEY VARIABLES ###########################

# as long as there is an infected agent in the population
# the trait/disease spreads

# you can count the number of infections per time step 
# or just save the grid 

########## PLOT OUR KEY VARIABLES ###################################

# get an idea what patterns this process produces


########## PLAY WITH PARAMETERS #####################################

# what are the parameters in this model? 
# how would you vary them?
# which parameters would you add?
