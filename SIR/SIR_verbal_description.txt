Whether it’s the flu, a viral video or the latest goss - contagion is everywhere. So it’s
good to understand how it works and think about how to model it. And influential
(analytical) model is the SIR-model, here’s how it works:

People can take one of three states, they can be Susceptible (S), Infected (I) or
Recovered (R). If patient 0 catches the bug, they change from Susceptibble to Infected. 
Infected individuals then pass on the infection with a certain probability to their 
Susceptible neighbours, and move on to Recovered status.

Think about spatially local spreading: You can only get the virus from someone who
is in sneezing distance, and you are only influenced in your fashion choices by people in 
your village.
