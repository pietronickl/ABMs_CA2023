Whether it’s the flu, a viral video or the latest goss - contagion is everywhere. So it’s
good to understand how it works and think about how to model it. And influential
(analytical) model is the SIR-model, here’s how it works:

People can take one of three states, they can be Susceptible (S), Infected (I) or
Recovered (R). If patient 0 catches the bug, they change from S to I. I then passes
on the infection with a certain probability to their Susceptible neighbours, and
move on to Recovered status.

Think about spatially local spreading: You can only get the virus from someone who
is in sneezing distance, and you are only influenced by people in your village.
