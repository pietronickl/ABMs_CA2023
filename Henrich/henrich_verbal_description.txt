Copying skills, tools or knowledge from experienced individuals is the prerequisite 
for culture. Humans would have gotten nowhere if you couldn’t learn from parents,
teachers and peers how to make a handaxe, prepare food without poisoning yourself
or tell a good bedtime story. Therefore the transmission of knowledge is important.

But what happens if transmission isn’t perfect? What are the chances of somebody
copying a skill/tool/information with 100% fidelity? 
Culture often seems to be cumulative, with innovations and successes relying on 
earlier achievements. But sometimes, cultural fitness drops... 
Under which circumstances does the cultural skill set of a community expand? 
And when does culture break down? Can you figure out the key variable(s)?
