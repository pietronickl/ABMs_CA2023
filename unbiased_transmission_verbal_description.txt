In (cultural) evolution it’s easy to assume that a trait spreads because it is adaptive.
After all, if it wasn’t, why would it catch on? Why would people preferentially copy it?
Better tools replace worse tools. Easier languages replace harder ones. Right? 

But why did shoulder pads die and off-the-shoulder tops stay? Is one better than the other?
A good baseline model for comparison is a model of unbiased transmission: random
copying. If we understand the signatures of this kind of behaviour, we can better spot
when there IS a bias in transmission favouring a specific trait.
