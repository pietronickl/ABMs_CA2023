# Intro to ABMs
Agent Based Models (ABMs) provide a bottom-up approach to simulate the population-level consequences of individual behaviour. ABMs often reveal unexpected or even counterintuitive emergent phenomena. Using ABMs, you can formulate “what-if” scenarios by playing with the model architecture and its parameters – essentially carrying out numeric thought experiments. 

Here you will find Jupyter notebooks for different ABMs. Choose one of these to get started:
- when knowledge grows and when it gets lost (a simple model of cultural transmission)
- fashion trends, baby names and good gossip (a simple model of cultural transmission)
- how diseases, news and trends spread (a simple contagion model)

You can choose at which level to engage with these. You can:
- formulate pseudocode based on the description. 
    - Who are your agents? What rules do they follow? Specify your model and which graphs you’d get out of it
- Look at pseudocode and turn it into a model, e.g. using your coding knowledge and chatGPT 
- Look at one of the specified models
    - Click through the model and follow the steps
    - Formulate tweaks to the model – how would you make it more relevant, interesting or realistic?
    - Change the parameters in the model to see how it behaves
    - Describe the model, e.g. with summary tables or in a nice graphic
