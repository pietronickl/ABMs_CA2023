########## DEFINE AGENTS AND BEHAVIOUR #############################

# you have a population of a certain size, who have varying skills 
# skills could be represented by random numbers in a range

# the next generation of social learners could preferentially copy
# the person with the highest skill level. however, they generally
# fall short of this skill level theselves. 
# maybe model this with a distribution... 

        
########## FOR LOOP, SAVING KEY VARIABLES ###########################

# this happens for many Generations
# we could track average skill or maximum skill of the generation 
# in a list
 

########## PLOT OUR KEY VARIABLES ###################################

# get an idea what patterns this process produces


########## PLAY WITH PARAMETERS #####################################

# what are the parameters in this model? 
# how could we vary them? 
# which parameters would you add? 
# is this a realistic model? what does it capture? what is left out?
